- As a Senior Cross-Platform Mobile Engineer, I specialize in designing and developing high-performance mobile applications using Flutter, Dart, and iOS. With 7+ years of hands-on experience, I focus on delivering scalable, reliable, and user-centric mobile solutions that align with business objectives and enhance digital experiences.

My approach combines technical precision with a strong sense of collaboration, ensuring every project achieves its maximum potential through teamwork, agile practices, and data-driven decision-making.
